# Simplest ZX Spectrum ASM toolchain (under win)

You still need to provide the [FUSE emulator](http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/#Download) (place fuse.exe and everything else on the 'emulator' folder) and the [sjASMplus](https://github.com/sjasmplus/sjasmplus) compiler (place .exe on 'assembler' folder)

Have fun!
